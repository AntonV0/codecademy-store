Codecademy Store
## Project #53 from Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer Career Path
### By Anton Vlasenko (AntonV0)  
## Project Outline
This React project uses Redux to display products found in Codecademy's online store. Various items in chosen quantities can be added/removed in the cart, which displays a summary of the selected items and their prices in one of three currencies (USD, EUR, CAD).

The main focus of this project is to begin using common Redux syntax and learn about different slices of state (inventory, cart, and currencyFilter).
## What I Learned
  - How to install Redux
  - Using multiple slices of state
  - Using the reducer composition design pattern to manage the Redux store
  - Creating a root reducer that delegates actions to slice reducers (reassembling slices into a new state object using the combineReducers() method)
